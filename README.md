  2b. Install the latest version of Unity 2018.4 through the Unity Hub
  2c. Add the newly cloned project to the Unity Hub, and select your newly installed version of Unity 2018.4 as the version (it is fine if it doesn't match exactly)
3. Under Build Settings, ensure your project is set to Android. 
  3a. Install the Android module if you don't already have it
4. Open the MainPrototypeScene scene
5. On your phone, run ARCore Instant Preview with the USB cable attached
